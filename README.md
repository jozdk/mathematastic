Just click on `New Game` to start a new game, type in your answer to the displayed arithmetical problem and click `Submit` (or hit `Enter`) to see the result. Once you reach the ninth square, the game finishes. Click on the podium icon in the bottom right corner of the screen to check out your best times.
